          <h3>Welcome to Nature's Source: Protecting your health naturally!</h3>
          <p>Founded in 1998, Nature's Source was created to serve those who
          use alternative healing methods. Offering only the highest quality
          vitamins, minerals, supplements &amp; herbal remedies, Nature's
          Source takes great pride in helping people live healthier, happier
          lives.</p>
          <p>Many Companies that talk about Customer Service fail to deliver.
          Nature's Source exists to truly serve all the needs of their
          customers. Each location features dedicated on-site therapists
          along with knowledgeable staff who ensure that every customer
          receives the best quality information available. Continuing
          Education seminars are a regular event at Nature's Source.</p>
